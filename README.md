CSS Rubik's Cube
================

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube demo made with CSS3.

As this demo uses advanced features from CSS3, some browsers will not be capable to support it. The newest version of Chrome should be sufficient as the demo was developed using Chrome.

CSS3 is extensively used, especially 3D transformations and transitions (animations).

JavaScript is used for generating sequence of random moves, and to add/remove classes to/from appropriate elements in order to trigger animations.
